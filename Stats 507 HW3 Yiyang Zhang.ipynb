    "\n",
    "2. **Make sure you back up your work!** At a minimum, do your work in a Dropbox\n",
    "folder. Better yet, use git, which is well worth your time and effort to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Be careful to follow directions!** Remember that Python is case sensitive. If\n",
    "you are ask you to define a function called my_function and you define a function\n",
    "called My_Function, you will not receive full credit. You may want to copy-paste\n",
